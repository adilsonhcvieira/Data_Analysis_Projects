EDA Analysis using Python
Here, you'll find a comprehensive analysis of a dataset that includes customer ratings, sales figures, and gross income. Using Python and powerful libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I performed various analyses to uncover valuable insights.

Starting with Initial Data Exploration, I familiarized myself with the project's objectives and tools. Then, I delved into Univariate Analysis, examining numeric and categorical variables through visualizations.

In Bivariate Analysis, I explored relationships between customer ratings, gross income, and other factors using scatterplots, regression plots, and boxplots. I also conducted a time series analysis to identify trends in gross income over three months.

To ensure data quality, I addressed duplicate rows and missing values, replacing them with column means. Additionally, I used Pandas Profiler to automate exploratory data analysis.

Finally, I conducted Correlation Analysis, calculating correlations between numeric variables and visualizing them with a heatmap.

This repository showcases my expertise in Python-based data analysis, visualization, and data cleaning techniques. Feel free to explore the code and analyses to uncover valuable insights from the dataset.
