In this dashboard, I conducted an analysis of average per capita CO2 emissions using data sourced from the World Bank. The dataset, downloaded from Kaggle, covers the time frame from 1960 to 2011. By visualizing the data using Tableau, I observed that East Asia & the Pacific has emerged as the largest emitter of CO2 since the 1990s. Remarkably, their emissions surpassed the combined emissions of the second and third largest regions in the world, namely Europe and North America. Notably, Africa continues to exhibit the lowest CO2 emissions among continents/regions globally.
