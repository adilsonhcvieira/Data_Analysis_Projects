I built this interactive dashboard for a human resources department with the aim of creating a demographic data page for employees using Power BI, which provides an overview of the organization's demographics. On the first page of the dashboard, we used pie charts and donut charts to visualize both racial and gender diversity. On the second page, I created an employee details section that provides all the important information about any employee with just one click. Additionally, I incorporated buttons, themes, slicers, and filters to make the panel more interactive and useful. For data formatting and cleaning, I utilized Excel, while Power BI was employed to develop the dashboard. The dataset was obtained from the internet.
